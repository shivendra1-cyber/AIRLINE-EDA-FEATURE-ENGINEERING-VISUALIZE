## Introduction

Welcome to the Airline Data EDA, Feature Engineering, and Visualization project. In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of airline-related data to gain insights into the performance and characteristics of various airlines. The goal is to understand trends, extract useful features, and present the findings through visualizations.

**Why did we choose this project?**
- Airlines play a critical role in global transportation, and their operations impact millions of travelers daily. Analyzing airline data can help identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall travel experience.

**What questions are we trying to answer?**
- What are the common causes of flight delays?
- Is there a relationship between flight distance and delays?
- Can we identify patterns in seasonal variations of airline performance?
- What insights can we gain from passenger statistics?

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a fictional dataset representing various airlines. It includes information such as flight details, passenger statistics, and operational data. You can access the dataset in CSV format [here](https://example.com/airline-dataset.csv).

**What are the key attributes in the dataset?**
- Flight ID
- Airline
- Scheduled Departure
- Actual Departure
- Distance
- Passenger Count

**What does each attribute represent, and why is it important?**
- Flight ID: Unique identifier for each flight.
- Airline: The airline operating the flight.
- Scheduled Departure: The scheduled departure time of the flight.
- Actual Departure: The actual departure time of the flight.
- Distance: The distance in miles for the flight.
- Passenger Count: The number of passengers on the flight.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we explore the dataset to uncover insights and trends.

**What are the summary statistics for the key attributes?**
- Flight delays, distances, and passenger counts.
- Distribution of flight delays to identify common patterns.

**What are the major findings from the EDA?**
- On average, flights experience a delay of 15 minutes.
- Flight delays have a right-skewed distribution.
- Most flights fall into the 'short-haul' category.

**What are the common questions arising from the EDA?**
- What factors contribute to flight delays?
- Are there specific airlines with consistently better on-time performance?
- How do flight delays vary by time of day?

**What visualizations have been created to support the analysis?**
- A bar chart showing the number of flights per time of day.
- A scatter plot displaying the relationship between distance and flight delays.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial step in enhancing the dataset for more meaningful analysis.

**What new features have been created, and why?**
- **Flight Time of Day:** Categorized flights into time slots (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- **Distance Categories:** Grouped flights by distance (short-haul, medium-haul, long-haul).

**How do these new features enhance the dataset?**
- Flight Time of Day allows us to analyze performance trends throughout the day.
- Distance Categories help us understand how flight distances relate to delays.

**What questions can be answered with these new features?**
- Do delays vary significantly during different times of the day?
- Is there a clear relationship between flight distance and delays?

## Visualization

Visualizations are essential to convey our findings effectively.

**What are the most significant visualizations used to communicate the results?**
- A bar chart showing the number of flights per time of day.
- A scatter plot displaying the relationship between distance and flight delays.

**How do these visualizations help in answering our questions?**
- The bar chart highlights the busiest times of day for flights.
- The scatter plot shows whether flight distance correlates with delays.

**What other visualizations could provide further insights?**
- Heatmap of delays by airline and time of day.
- Line chart showing the trend in delays over the year.
